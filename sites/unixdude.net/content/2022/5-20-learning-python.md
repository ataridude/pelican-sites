I have been programming in Perl since the early 1990s.  My early scripts were what you would expect them to be, but my skill
of course increased over time.  I have never found a thing I wanted to do that I could not do in Perl and/or shell scripting
(Bourne when portability is needed, Bash when it is not).

For my job, I need to learn Python, and a friend recommends the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com).
In addition to the book, the author also has a Udemy course, and I am working my way through that right now.  One of the examples given
in the course is a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Earlier this week, as I was going through the course, I had [WarGames](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/) playing silently on the TV.
Right when the movie got to "put X in the center square," my course also got to "put X in the center square."  See attached pic ... not
faked, and not timed.  It just worked out this way.

Anyway, I decided to [write a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python](https://github.com/ataridude/learning-python), and seeing as I have 1- never written
a game in my life, and 2- never written a line of Python, I think this is a pretty good first attempt.  The only thing I took from the
course example was the idea for the hash data type; 100% of the rest of this was my own.
