My work laptop, a 2018 MacBook Pro, needs a new battery and so I will be shipping it off to
have that serviced.  Prior to getting that serviced, I need a temporary system, so I 
went to the office to grab one of the spares we have, another 2018 MBP.  This system was
used by a former coworker, one who retired months ago, and he
no longer remembers the firmware password he configured on the system.

I thought this system was a brick, until an Apple expert pointed me to the [DFU restore option
using Apple Configurator 2](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-an-intel-based-mac-apdebea5be51/mac).
The startup key sequence for this is ... tricky.  I tried it a few times, but was not successful
until I watched [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVgBP4gJsU) that demonstrates
the process.

Using DFU mode, I first tried the Revive option.  The laptop booted back to the firmware prompt, so
I then tried the Restore option, which caused this laptop to boot into Internet Recovery mode.
Perfect!  Now I have this unit installing its original OS -- Mojave -- and will update to Big Sur
once it is done.

Internet Recovery is cool, but slow.  It's a little faster over ethernet versus wifi, especially
with a gigabit connection, but it's still slow.  Anyway, this thing is working now and is no
longer a brick, so it's good now.
