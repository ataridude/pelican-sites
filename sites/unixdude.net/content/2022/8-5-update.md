I've been busy at home, but not working in my home lab.  Lately I have been preoccupied by a few things.

First, I have been busy with prepping -- I can see how things are going, and I predict we will need
stores of supplies, so I have been busy building those stores of supplies.  Specifically, I have been
going through [The Prepper's Roadmap](https://www.cityprepping.com) with my wife, and we have been 
learning a lot.

Second, I studied for and passed the technician class amateur radio license exam.  I bought a [Baofeng
UV-5R](https://rigreference.com/rigs/6009-baofeng-uv-5r) and find that I am too far from the local repeaters to use it, so I'll sell this and find a better HT.  I also picked
up a [Yaesu FT-7800R](https://rigreference.com/rigs/4345-yaesu-ft-7800re) for my truck, and hope to get that installed soon.

Third, my family and I traveled to Orlando for a week at Disney World -- we went to the Magic Kingdom
and Hollywood Studios, but unfortunately we missed EPCOT since I got sick and have been sick for the
last week.  We hope to head down to EPCOT sometime in the next few months to make up for the day we
missed.  Speaking of Disney, Galaxy's Edge is quite possibly the best themed area I have ever visited,
and Rise of the Resistance is without question the best theme experience I have ever had in my life.

Back to the update...  We have more prepping to do -- skills to learn, materials to gather, and bags
and vehicles to pack -- but after that I hope to get back to my home lab.
