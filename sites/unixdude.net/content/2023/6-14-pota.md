[Parks On The Air](https://parksontheair.com), or POTA, is one of the aspects of amateur radio that I have been
enjoying -- both hunting and activating.  Ever since I starting doing POTA activations, I have been carrying my
equipment in a Rubbermaid container, which is bulky and heavy.  The only thing it has going for it is
that it carries everything I need.

Pretty much since getting started doing POTA, I have wanted a battery box and a radio box.  I did a lot
of research about battery boxes, and there are many different options, both [DIY](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=diy+battery+box) and [ready-made ones for purchase](https://powerwerx.com/solar-portable-power).  Somewhere I saw a build
that used the [Harbor Freight Tactical Ammo Box](https://www.harborfreight.com/tool-storage-organization/tool-boxes-bags-belts/utility-cases-ammo-boxes/tactical-ammoutility-box-64113.html), and
I decided to use that box for my build.  I went with this box because I really like the idea of having all of the controls
and connections under the flip-top lid on that box, rather than on the outside of the box, which is how
most of these boxes are built.

Over the weekend, with the help of a local ham friend, I built my battery box.  Installed on my box are
dual PowerPole connectors, dual USB connectors behind a rocker switch and 5A fuse, and a 50A circuit breaker as the main power switch.  There is room for more connections should I choose to add them.

The Harbor Freight box I used has the benefit of being a little larger than the typical battery box, so in
addition to the [Bioenno BLF-1215A](https://www.bioennopower.com/collections/lifepo4-batteries-for-communication-equipment-ham-radio/products/copy-of-12v-15ah-lfp-battery-pvc-blf-1215w?variant=19610918405),
I am also able to carry my 40/20/15/10 EFHW [antenna](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5448369),
[NanoVNA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z5VY7B6/), [battery monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Precision-Consumption-Performance-Backlight/dp/B0B8VWNY9X/), and Bioenno battery charger -- all inside the battery box.  Today, the ability to
carry all these extra items seems like a benefit; time will tell if that impression holds.

I also finally cut out the foam in my [Apache 3800](https://www.harborfreight.com/3800-weatherproof-protective-case-large-black-63927.html)
case to carry my radio (an [Icom IC-706MKIIG](http://www.icomamerica.com/en/products/amateur/hf/706/default.aspx)), along with its microphone and power cord, and [nifty mini-manual](https://www.niftyaccessories.com/IC-706MKIIG.php).

I am very pleased with the result for both of these, and look forward to using this kit at an upcoming POTA activation.
