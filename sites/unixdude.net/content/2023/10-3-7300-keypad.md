I recently purchased an [Icom IC-7300](https://www.icomamerica.com/lineup/products/IC-7300/) ham radio for use at home, and when
researching the radio around the time of purchase, I discovered
[this excellent YouTube video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL48JZWhCJoH3bGOyfmZVxgRHFqs2VUG8P),
covering many aspects of the radio.

When I got to [video 46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3b1aNdg3pQ),
I discovered that the IC-7300 supports an external keypad, and decided
I wanted one of my own.  This past weekend, I made one.

In addition to using that video, I found [this page](http://www.whiskeytangohotel.com/2020/03/icom-ic7300-memory-external-keypad.html)
detailing another guy's external keypad build.

I don't have a drill press, but I think my unit came out well.  I could have done a better job with the feet, but this works well enough.
