A while back, I moved my FT-7800R to my hamshack, and bought an FTM-400XDM to replace
it in the truck, so I thought an update was in order.  I never fully mounted the FT-7800R
control head, but after switching to the FTM-400, I finished the permanent install by
mounting the control head.

I bought a Bulletpoint Mounting Solutions RubiGrid
for my F150, and some RAM Mount balls and arms to mount the control head.

Because the FTM-400 microphone only connects to the main radio unit, I needed
to get an extension cable for that.  I also needed a longer cable for the
control head, which I built myself since it only needed flat 4-conductor cable and
RJ 4P4C connectors, which I already had on hand.

I'm pretty impressed with the results of this install.
