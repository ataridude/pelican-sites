Hi.  My name is Daniel, and I am Unix System Engineer based in the Raleigh, NC area.  I have two main areas of interest in IT: operating systems and networking/communications.

Regarding operating systems, you probably guessed (correctly) that I prefer Unix-like OSes.  My first introduction to Unix was on a [DEC MicroVAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroVAX){:target="_blank"}, in 1989.  I was at university, wandering down the hall in my dorm (NCSU's Turlington Hall), and I saw a command prompt that I knew was not a DOS prompt.  I started up a conversation with my fellow resident, who told me all about it.  Ever since then, it has been Unix all the way for me: Ultrix,
IRIX, A/UX, various BSDs, various Linux distributions, NeXTSTEP, SunOS, Solaris, and macOS, and many others.  My current favorites are FreeBSD and macOS.

Regarding networking/communications, I was once a ham radio operator, and I collect antique telephones.  My favorite phone is a US Navy shipboard phone I picked up at
an antique show.  I find a computer to be useless to me unless it is reachable remotely.

Put these things together, and you find my sweet spot: network infrastructure (Cisco routers and switches, F5 load balancers, and Radware WAFs) and virtualization
(VMware vCenter).

I also do quite a bit today with Ansible.  We automate as much as we can using that tool.

Current certifications:

- VCP6 - VMware Certified Professional

In progress:

- CCNA - Cisco Certified Network Associate
- F5-CA - F5 Certified BIG-IP Administrator

I am also an Atari fan, and I run an Atari-related blog at [ataridude.net](https://www.ataridude.net/).
