Since I bought my Cisco equipment, I have had it racked in the cheap, two-post desktop rack
that came with the equipment when I bought it.  It was pretty bad, but it worked:

I really wanted something better than this, so I started doing some web searches to get
ideas on what I could do better.  Along the way, I discovered [Hayden James's home lab beginner's guide](https://haydenjames.io/home-lab-beginners-guide-hardware/),
and decided I wanted a wall-mount rack.  I did a lot of research about wall-mount racks, and
I settled on the [Networks adjustable depth, swing-out 12U rack](https://www.networxproducts.com/12u-adjustable-depth-open-frame-swing-out-wall-mount-rack-301-series-flat-packed).

The rack arrived last week, and I was able to mount it earlier this week.  I still
have lots of work to do here, and this is going to be a huge improvement over the original
setup.
