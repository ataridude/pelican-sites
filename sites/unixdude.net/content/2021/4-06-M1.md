I recently decided to upgrade my personal laptop.  Until recently, I was using a 2015 MacBook Pro that I
bought in 2016 after Apple announced they were bringing the butterfly keyboard to the MBP.  My goal for
that purchase was for it to last until Apple released a better keyboard -- and it worked.  Last month I
traded my 2015 MBP for a new 2020 M1-powered MacBook Air, and I could not be happier with this upgrade:
The M1 is an amazing CPU, the keyboard is awesome, and the M1 MBA is a phenomenal package.

Because of my love of operating systems (specifically Unix-based ones, obviously), one of the first
things I did with this system was to download the [technical preview of Parallels Desktop for M1](https://b2b.parallels.com/Apple-Silicon), so that I could run VMs on this new laptop.

So far, I have installed [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/en/server/download/), [Photon OS](https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki/Downloading-Photon-OS), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm), [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64), and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/where/).  Most of
those distros/OSes install exactly as you would hope, but a few required some special tweaks.

For Alpine and Photon OS, I found that the Parallels VM must be configured as a Debian VM.

For FreeBSD, I used "Other Linux" as the OS type, and the most important part for FreeBSD is to
configure the VM to use only 1 vCPU -- it will not boot with more than 1 vCPU.

So far I am extremely impressed with this M1 unit.  With the ability to run such a variety of
operating systems in VMs, it will prove even more useful to me.
