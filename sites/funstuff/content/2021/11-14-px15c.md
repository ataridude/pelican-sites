I like to build electronics kits.  I don't have superior skills in this area, but I can work a soldering iron,
and I enjoy the time.  My most recent project was to build a [PX-15C](https://www.tindie.com/products/hobbystone/px-15c-an-hp15c-emulator/),
an [HP-15C](http://mycalcdb.free.fr/main.php?l=0&id=815) emulator.

HP RPN calculators have been my favorites since I was introduced to them at university: RPN is a much more natural fit for the
way I think, so I purchased an HP-28S, which became my go-to calculator until I got an HP48G.  I always liked the landscape layout of the
HP-15C, but I never owned one.

Recently I saw [a post on hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2021/08/31/calculate-like-its-1989-with-this-hp15c-emulator/) about
the PX-15C calculator kit, and I decided I needed to add this kit to my portfolio.  It was weeks before the kits were back in stock,
but I eventually received my kit and set to work.

This is a great kit, and the fruit of my labor is a cool, useful calculator.  Next I want to build the same seller's [PX41C kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/hobbystone/px41c-an-hp41c-hardware-emulator/),
which as I'm sure you guessed is an HP-41C emulator.

I got a case for my kit as well, and the Tindie seller has printable keyboard overlays, as you can see in these pics.

Finally, a family photo showing my HP-28S, HP48G, and PX-15C.  What a great set of calculators!  And yes, they all work.
