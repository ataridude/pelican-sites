One of the things I have been wanting to get for my [Chronosport](/posts/2021/Nov/12/chronosport-sea-quartz-30) is a [Tropic Strap](https://tropicstrap.com), like
Tom Selleck wore in the 1980s show, [Magnum, p.i.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080240/).  This weekend, I got the strap, and
I thought I would write a little bit about it and post a few pics.  (All images are high-resolution, and can be seen at full size
by loading the image directly.)

At this point, I'm very used to stainless steel oyster bracelets, so it took a little while for me to get used to
this strap.  After a few hours of wearing it, I find it to be very comfortable, and this combination is now my
favorite of the watches I own (see final pic).  My second favorite, which I'm sure will be back to my favorite next
week, is my Steinhart Pepsi GMT watch.

The Tropic strap came in this cool little box that, no, I did not keep.  "Cool," "rugged," "good looking."  It's
definitely a good looking strap, and it looks great on the Chronosport, which itself is an attractive dive watch,
never mind the Magnum connection.

As mentioned, I think this watch/strap combination looks truly fantastic:
