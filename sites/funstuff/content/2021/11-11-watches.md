I have always liked watches.  In the 1980s, as a teen, it was Casio watches,
and I bought a new one at least annually, whether I needed one or not.
My favorites were the ones with special features, specifically the [DBC-61](https://www.watchuseek.com/threads/history-of-casio-dbc-dbx-and-dbm-data-bank-calculator-watches.5225262/).
I also had one of the Telememo 30 models, and that was pretty neat.

At university, I became interested in analog watches, so I purchased several Swatch chronographs.

A few years ago, I got interested in automatic watches, and my first purchase was a
[Steinhart Ocean One GMT blue/red](https://www.steinhartwatches.de/en/diver-watch/diver-watch-42mm/gmt-ocean-1-blue-red.html).  Later
I participated in [Maen's kickstarter for their Hudson watch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maenwatches/vintage-inspired-dive-watch-with-eta-2824-2-swiss).

I purchased the Steinhart because it is reminiscent of the [Rolex GMT-Master II](https://www.rolex.com/watches/gmt-master-ii.html), which is way out of my price range.
I became interested in the Steinhart because I am a huge fan of the original Magnum, p.i. series, after I was introduced to the Steinhart on [a thread on the Magnum forums](http://magnum-mania.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=2053).

Even more recently, I decided to look for an example of the Chronosport Sea Quartz 30 that Tom Selleck wore in the show.  Last week, I saw an [eBay listing for a Chronosport](https://www.ebay.com/itm/114967072963),
and ended up winning it.  This watch was sold to me by the original owner, who purchased it in January of 1982, and had it service several times before he put it in a drawer in 1991.
