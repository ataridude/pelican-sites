As I mentioned in a previous post, I recently bought a Chronosport Sea Quartz 30 from its original
owner.  I have finally edited scans of the paperwork to remove the original owner's personal information,
and I link those scans here.

I have the original purchase receipt, manual, and paperwork for all service done to the watch.

All images are high-resolution scans that can be seen at full-resolution by opening the image directly.

Enjoy!
