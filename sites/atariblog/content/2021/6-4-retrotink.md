As I mentioned in my previous update, my Vizio TV does not like the UAV's composite
output: the 5200's output is very jumpy.  The 2600's output is not solid either, but
it acts differently from the 5200.

Somewhere in the last month, I learned about [RetroTINK products](https://www.retrotink.com/),
which are designed to solve just this problem: they correctly interpret the analog
output from the game system, and convert it to HDMI output that the TV then
correctly upscales to full size.

I purchased [a RetroTINK 2X-MINI](https://www.retrotink.com/product-page/2x-mini), which
converts composite and S-video to 480p, and wowee!  The image is solid and beautiful, with
crisper lines and brighter, more vibrant colors, probably just about the best you can get from an analog Atari output.

I am using composite today, but I have decided that I will modify my systems for S-video, since
the 2X-MINI supports S-video input as well as composite.  The combination of UAV+RetroTINK is
probably the best it can get from an Atari with analog outputs.  Perhaps the only better
image can be had via HDMI, such as with a [RetroN 77](https://www.hyperkin.com/retro/retron-77.html) or
Sophia chip for the 5200.

Pictures show this better than words can describe it, so...

Here's my 5200 over RF:
