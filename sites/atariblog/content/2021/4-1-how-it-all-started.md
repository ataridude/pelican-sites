My journey started 10-15 years ago, when I bought an XEGS from an eBay seller.
I have used that XEGS as a cartridge console gamine system, with classic favorites
such as Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Defender, Joust, and of course Missile Command.
Until recently, this was my only Atari system.

I wanted an Atari 2600 since I first saw one in 1977.  My parents were opposed
to video games, so I never got one.  Instead, I sometimes played at friends' houses.

Similarly, I wanted an Atari 800 since I first saw one in 1979.  My father worked at IBM, so
we instead had IBM PCs.  I bought a PCjr after their release in 1984, and I never got that
Atari 800 I wanted.

Two years ago, I bought a 2600 from a local seller on Craigslist.  It came with about
20 games, and I have been enjoying it ever since.

A few weeks later, I bought an 800, 600XL, 800XL, a 410, and an 850 off a local seller on eBay.

The 600XL is LNIB, and I wonder if it was ever used other than for the eBay seller to test it.

The 800XL powers up to a black screen, and I am in the process of repairing it.  At this point
I think all it needs is new RAM, which I will purchase from [The Brewing Academy](https://thebrewingacademy.com).

The 800 was in pretty good shape, but some of the keys did not work.  I ended up buying a second
800 from a local Craigslister, and cobbling together a single good system.  I then modified it with
an Incognito board, and the 800 has been my main 8-bit Atari system since I completed that mod.
