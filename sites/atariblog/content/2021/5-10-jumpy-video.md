Title: Jumpy video from 5200

Since completing the UAV & power mods on my 5200, I have noticed that the
5200's video output is very jumpy on my Vizio D43fx-F4 TV.  I took a
[slow-motion-video](/images/atari-5200-jumpy-video.mov) that demonstrates
the problem.

I have learned that Vizio TVs often have trouble with the composite output
produced by the UAV, so as part of my
troubleshooting process, I connected my 5200 to my other TV, a Sharp LC-52D64U.
The 5200's composite signal to the Sharp is solid and strong, so now we have
determined that the problem is the TV.

I ordered [an OREI composite/S-video to HDMI converter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UNYX9M/) which
should arrive tomorrow.  Reports from other AtariAge users are that this unit
works well; I'll see.

My 2600 also has jumpy video, but it's not a fast jump like 5200: where the
5200's issue just looks like a fuzzy screen (because it is basically a fast-motion,
1-pixel up-and-down jump), the 2600's issue is that it seems to lose sync, and
the image is scrolled about 1/4 to 1/3 of the way up.  Even so, I wonder if the TV is
the problem with the 2600, and if the converter box will fix it.  I'm guessing that if
it works for the 5200, it will also solve the 2600's problem.  I hope so -- it would
be nice to have both of these issues fixed.
