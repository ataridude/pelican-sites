Title: Another UAV-modded 2600

My Vader 2600, the first system I modded with UAV, was not known good when I started.
In fact, I bought it because the seller listed it as nonfunctional, and these things seem
to run forever so I didn't believe his ad for a nonfunctional 2600.

The modified Vader has some minor video issues.  I know that some of the video issues are known:
one is related to incompatibilities between Asteroids, UAV, and modern TVs. Some
other games have some problems as well, but those might be bad cartridges, and in any case
I decided to UAV-modify my second 2600.

I pulled the UAV out of my 5200
that displays only black-and-white, so this one has the socket pins on it, and
I didn't bother removing those.

Here's today's project system:

It started with snowy RF video:

I first did the install by soldering to the CPU legs, but I really don't like
doing this, so I decided to redo it.  I checked schematics and located components on the board
that connect to the pins the UAV needs.  I looped around the component leads, 
and this results in a much stronger connection:

Once again, the combination of the RetroTINK 2X-MINI and UAV produces impressive output over a composite connection:

I didn't do a great job lining up the RCA jacks; oh well:

But internally they are fine:

Here's where I stopped, but I am going to redo this:

AtariAge user -^CrossBow^- [recommended that I reuse the RF shield and mount the UAV below the reset switch](https://atariage.com/forums/topic/322086-question-for-the-uav-modders-out-there/?do=findComment&comment=4849359)
so I will be doing that soon.  It will certainly make this install much cleaner.

As with my other UAV-modded systems, I will be adding S-video to this unit once the connectors arrive.
